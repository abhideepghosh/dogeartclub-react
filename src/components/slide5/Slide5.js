          The best and absolute unique utility of Doge Art Club is its
          innovative Doge mechanism. Take your Doge to the Gym - an
          inhouse-built NFT staking solution where your Doge can train and gain
          strength and experience. Continuous staking unlocks the final form of
          your Doge - the Buffed Doge. It’s a separate NFT that you can then
          claim for free!

          If that’s not enough, every single Doge will get so euphoric they’ll
          unlock the
          <br /> Buffed Doge as soon as they go to the moon - when dogecoin
          price reaches <br />
          $1, or as soon as rocket DOGE-1 (actually scheduled for a moon
          mission) <br />
          lands on the Moon!
